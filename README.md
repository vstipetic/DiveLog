## DiveLog
A dive log with advanced search and statistics functionality (to be added eventually). Main purpose is to extract fun statistics from your dive log or find interesting trends in your dives.

## Basic functionality
Parsing is only supported for .fit files from Garmin dive computers. More might be added in the future. Currently you need to manually log each dive by using the LogDive.py function as described in its documentation.

## Searching
